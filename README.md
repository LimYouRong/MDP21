# Multi-Disciplinary Project
With an odd-numbered group of 7, the planning for the distribution of work is tricky since certain members have to take additional workload. We huddled our efforts to assist one another whenever possible. Before the start of the project, none of the members had any prior knowledge on the assigned tasks. It became our responsibility to figure out the individual requirements. Through rigorous weeks of correcting the robotâ€™s movement and bulldozing the obstacles, our team assembled an autonomous robot system which completed tasks from the checklist and successfully attempted the fastest path, image recognition and exploration challenge.
